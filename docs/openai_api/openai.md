Text generation
===============

Learn how to generate text from a prompt.

OpenAI provides simple APIs to use a [large language model](/docs/models) to generate text from a prompt, as you might using [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com). These models have been trained on vast quantities of data to understand multimedia inputs and natural language instructions. From these [prompts](/docs/guides/prompt-engineering), models can generate almost any kind of text response, like code, mathematical equations, structured JSON data, or human-like prose.

Quickstart
----------

To generate text, you can use the [chat completions endpoint](/docs/api-reference/chat/) in the REST API, as seen in the examples below. You can either use the [REST API](/docs/api-reference) from the HTTP client of your choice, or use one of OpenAI's [official SDKs](/docs/libraries) for your preferred programming language.

Generate prose

Create a human-like response to a prompt

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";
const openai = new OpenAI();

const completion = await openai.chat.completions.create({
    model: "gpt-4o",
    messages: [
        { role: "developer", content: "You are a helpful assistant." },
        {
            role: "user",
            content: "Write a haiku about recursion in programming.",
        },
    ],
    store: true,
});

console.log(completion.choices[0].message);
```

```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o",
    messages=[
        {"role": "developer", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Write a haiku about recursion in programming."
        }
    ]
)

print(completion.choices[0].message)
```

```bash
curl "https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
    -d '{
        "model": "gpt-4o",
        "messages": [
            {
                "role": "developer",
                "content": "You are a helpful assistant."
            },
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": "Write a haiku about recursion in programming."
            }
        ]
    }'
```

Analyze an image

Describe the contents of an image

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";
const openai = new OpenAI();

const completion = await openai.chat.completions.create({
    model: "gpt-4o",
    messages: [
        {
            role: "user",
            content: [
                { type: "text", text: "What's in this image?" },
                {
                    type: "image_url",
                    image_url: {
                        "url": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/Gfp-wisconsin-madison-the-nature-boardwalk.jpg/2560px-Gfp-wisconsin-madison-the-nature-boardwalk.jpg",
                    },
                }
            ],
        },
    ],
    store: true,
});

            }
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }'
```

Generate JSON data

Generate JSON data based on a JSON Schema

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";
const openai = new OpenAI();

const completion = await openai.chat.completions.create({
    model: "gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
    messages: [
        { role: "developer", content: "You extract email addresses into JSON data." },
        {
            role: "user",
            content: "Feeling stuck? Send a message to help@mycompany.com.",
        },
    ],
    response_format: {
        // See /docs/guides/structured-outputs
        type: "json_schema",
        json_schema: {
            name: "email_schema",
            schema: {

                        type: "string"
                    }
                },
                additionalProperties: false
            }
        }
    },
    store: true,
});

console.log(completion.choices[0].message.content);

            "additionalProperties": false
        }
      }
    }
  }'
```

Choosing a model
----------------

When making a text generation request, your first decision is which [model](/docs/models) you want to generate the response. The model you choose influences output and impacts [cost](https://openai.com/api/pricing/).

*   A **large model** like [`gpt-4o`](/docs/models#gpt-4o) offers a very high level of intelligence and strong performance, with higher cost per token.
*   A **small model** like [`gpt-4o-mini`](/docs/models#gpt-4o-mini) offers intelligence not quite on the level of the larger model, but it's faster and less expensive per token.
*   A **reasoning model** like [the `o1` family of models](/docs/models#o1) is slower to return a result, and uses more tokens to "think," but is capable of advanced reasoning, coding, and multi-step planning.

Experiment with different models [in the Playground](/playground) to see which works best for your prompts! You might also benefit from our [model selection best practices](/docs/guides/model-selection).

Building prompts
----------------

The process of crafting prompts to get the right output from a model is called **prompt engineering**. You can improve output by giving the model precise instructions, examples, and necessary context information—like private or specialized information not included in the model's training data.

Below is high-level guidance on building prompts. For more in-depth strategies and tactics, see the [prompt engineering guide](/docs/guides/prompt-engineering).

### Messages and roles

In the [chat completions API](/docs/api-reference/chat/), you create prompts by providing an array of `messages` that contain instructions for the model. Each message can have a different `role`, which influences how the model might interpret the input.

||
|user|Instructions that request some output from the model. Similar to messages you'd type in ChatGPT as an end user.|Pass your end-user's message to the model.Write a haiku about programming.|
|developer|Instructions to the model that are prioritized ahead of user messages, following chain of command. Previously called the system prompt.|Describe how the model should generally behave and respond.You are a helpful assistant
that answers programming
questions in the style of a
southern belle from the
southeast United States.Now, any response to a user message should have a southern belle personality and tone.|
|assistant|A message generated by the model, perhaps in a previous generation request (see the "Conversations" section below).|Provide examples to the model for how it should respond to the current request.For example, to get a model to respond correctly to knock-knock jokes, you might provide a full back-and-forth dialogue of a knock-knock joke.|

Message roles may help you get better responses, especially if you want a model to follow hierarchical instructions. They're not deterministic, so the best way to use them is just trying things and seeing what gives you good results.

Here's an example of a developer message that modifies the behavior of the model when generating a response to a `user` message:

```javascript
const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: "gpt-4o",
  messages: [
    {
      "role": "developer",
      "content": [
        {
          "type": "text",
          "text": `
            You are a helpful assistant that answers programming 
            questions in the style of a southern belle from the 
            southeast United States.
          `
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": [
        {
          "type": "text",
          "text": "Are semicolons optional in JavaScript?"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  store: true,
});
```

This prompt returns a text output in the rhetorical style requested:

```text
Well, sugar, that's a fine question you've got there! Now, in the 
world of JavaScript, semicolons are indeed a bit like the pearls 
on a necklace – you might slip by without 'em, but you sure do look 
more polished with 'em in place. 

Technically, JavaScript has this little thing called "automatic 
semicolon insertion" where it kindly adds semicolons for you 
where it thinks they oughta go. However, it's not always perfect, 
bless its heart. Sometimes, it might get a tad confused and cause 
all sorts of unexpected behavior.
```

### Giving the model additional data to use for generation

You can also use the message types above to provide additional information to the model, outside of its training data. You might want to include the results of a database query, a text document, or other resources to help the model generate a relevant response. This technique is often referred to as **retrieval augmented generation**, or RAG. [Learn more about RAG techniques](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/8868588-retrieval-augmented-generation-rag-and-semantic-search-for-gpts).

Conversations and context
-------------------------

While each text generation request is independent and stateless (unless you're using [assistants](/docs/assistants/overview)), you can still implement **multi-turn conversations** by providing additional messages as parameters to your text generation request. Consider a "knock knock" joke:

```javascript
const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: "gpt-4o",
  messages: [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": [{ "type": "text", "text": "knock knock." }]
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": [{ "type": "text", "text": "Who's there?" }]
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": [{ "type": "text", "text": "Orange." }]
    }
  ],
  store: true,
});
```

By using alternating `user` and `assistant` messages, you capture the previous state of a conversation in one request to the model.

### Managing context for text generation

As your inputs become more complex, or you include more turns in a conversation, you'll need to consider both **output token** and **context window** limits. Model inputs and outputs are metered in [**tokens**](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936856-what-are-tokens-and-how-to-count-them), which are parsed from inputs to analyze their content and intent and assembled to render logical outputs. Models have limits on token usage during the lifecycle of a text generation request.

*   **Output tokens** are the tokens generated by a model in response to a prompt. Each model has different [limits for output tokens](/docs/models). For example, `gpt-4o-2024-08-06` can generate a maximum of 16,384 output tokens.
*   A **context window** describes the total tokens that can be used for both input and output tokens (and for some models, [reasoning tokens](/docs/guides/reasoning)). Compare the [context window limits](/docs/models) of our models. For example, `gpt-4o-2024-08-06` has a total context window of 128k tokens.

If you create a very large prompt (usually by including a lot of conversation context or additional data/examples for the model), you run the risk of exceeding the allocated context window for a model, which might result in truncated outputs.

Use the [tokenizer tool](/tokenizer), built with the [tiktoken library](https://github.com/openai/tiktoken), to see how many tokens are in a particular string of text.

Optimizing model outputs
------------------------

As you iterate on your prompts, you'll continually aim to improve **accuracy**, **cost**, and **latency**. Below, find techniques that optimize for each goal.

||
|Accuracy|Ensure the model produces accurate and useful responses to your prompts.|Accurate responses require that the model has all the information it needs to generate a response, and knows how to go about creating a response (from interpreting input to formatting and styling). Often, this will require a mix of prompt engineering, RAG, and model fine-tuning.Learn more about optimizing for accuracy.|
|Cost|Drive down total cost of using models by reducing token usage and using cheaper models when possible.|To control costs, you can try to use fewer tokens or smaller, cheaper models. Learn more about optimizing for cost.|
|Latency|Decrease the time it takes to generate responses to your prompts.|Optimizing for low latency is a multifaceted process including prompt engineering and parallelism in your own code. Learn more about optimizing for latency.|

Structured Outputs
==================

Ensure responses adhere to a JSON schema.

Try it out
----------

Try it out in the [Playground](/playground) or generate a ready-to-use schema definition to experiment with structured outputs.

Generate

Introduction
------------

JSON is one of the most widely used formats in the world for applications to exchange data.

Structured Outputs is a feature that ensures the model will always generate responses that adhere to your supplied [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/overview/what-is-jsonschema), so you don't need to worry about the model omitting a required key, or hallucinating an invalid enum value.

Some benefits of Structured Outputs include:

1.  **Reliable type-safety:** No need to validate or retry incorrectly formatted responses
2.  **Explicit refusals:** Safety-based model refusals are now programmatically detectable
3.  **Simpler prompting:** No need for strongly worded prompts to achieve consistent formatting

In addition to supporting JSON Schema in the REST API, the OpenAI SDKs for [Python](https://github.com/openai/openai-python/blob/main/helpers.md#structured-outputs-parsing-helpers) and [JavaScript](https://github.com/openai/openai-node/blob/master/helpers.md#structured-outputs-parsing-helpers) also make it easy to define object schemas using [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/) and [Zod](https://zod.dev/) respectively. Below, you can see how to extract information from unstructured text that conforms to a schema defined in code.

Getting a structured response

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";
import { zodResponseFormat } from "openai/helpers/zod";
import { z } from "zod";

const openai = new OpenAI();

const CalendarEvent = z.object({
  name: z.string(),
  date: z.string(),
  participants: z.array(z.string()),
});

const completion = await openai.beta.chat.completions.parse({
  model: "gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
  messages: [
    { role: "system", content: "Extract the event information." },
    { role: "user", content: "Alice and Bob are going to a science fair on Friday." },
  ],
  response_format: zodResponseFormat(CalendarEvent, "event"),
});

const event = completion.choices[0].message.parsed;
```

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

class CalendarEvent(BaseModel):
    name: str
    date: str
    participants: list[str]

completion = client.beta.chat.completions.parse(
    model="gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "Extract the event information."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Alice and Bob are going to a science fair on Friday."},
    ],
    response_format=CalendarEvent,
)

event = completion.choices[0].message.parsed
```

### Supported models

Structured Outputs are available in our [latest large language models](/docs/models), starting with GPT-4o:

*   `o3-mini-2025-1-31` and later
*   `o1-2024-12-17` and later
*   `gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18` and later
*   `gpt-4o-2024-08-06` and later

Older models like `gpt-4-turbo` and earlier may use [JSON mode](#json-mode) instead.

When to use Structured Outputs via function calling vs via response\_format
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Structured Outputs is available in two forms in the OpenAI API:

1.  When using [function calling](/docs/guides/function-calling)
2.  When using a `json_schema` response format

Function calling is useful when you are building an application that bridges the models and functionality of your application.

For example, you can give the model access to functions that query a database in order to build an AI assistant that can help users with their orders, or functions that can interact with the UI.

Conversely, Structured Outputs via `response_format` are more suitable when you want to indicate a structured schema for use when the model responds to the user, rather than when the model calls a tool.

For example, if you are building a math tutoring application, you might want the assistant to respond to your user using a specific JSON Schema so that you can generate a UI that displays different parts of the model's output in distinct ways.

Put simply:

*   If you are connecting the model to tools, functions, data, etc. in your system, then you should use function calling
*   If you want to structure the model's output when it responds to the user, then you should use a structured `response_format`

The remainder of this guide will focus on non-function calling use cases in the Chat Completions API. To learn more about how to use Structured Outputs with function calling, check out the [Function Calling](/docs/guides/function-calling#function-calling-with-structured-outputs) guide.

### Structured Outputs vs JSON mode

Structured Outputs is the evolution of [JSON mode](#json-mode). While both ensure valid JSON is produced, only Structured Outputs ensure schema adherance. Both Structured Outputs and JSON mode are supported in the Chat Completions API, Assistants API, Fine-tuning API and Batch API.

We recommend always using Structured Outputs instead of JSON mode when possible.

However, Structured Outputs with `response_format: {type: "json_schema", ...}` is only supported with the `gpt-4o-mini`, `gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18`, and `gpt-4o-2024-08-06` model snapshots and later.

||Structured Outputs|JSON Mode|
|---|---|---|
|Outputs valid JSON|Yes|Yes|
|Adheres to schema|Yes (see supported schemas)|No|
|Compatible models|gpt-4o-mini, gpt-4o-2024-08-06, and later|gpt-3.5-turbo, gpt-4-* and gpt-4o-* models|
|Enabling|response_format: { type: "json_schema", json_schema: {"strict": true, "schema": ...} }|response_format: { type: "json_object" }|

Examples
--------

Chain of thought

### Chain of thought

You can ask the model to output an answer in a structured, step-by-step way, to guide the user through the solution.

Structured Outputs for chain-of-thought math tutoring

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";
import { z } from "zod";
import { zodResponseFormat } from "openai/helpers/zod";

const openai = new OpenAI();

const Step = z.object({
  explanation: z.string(),
  output: z.string(),
});

const MathReasoning = z.object({
  steps: z.array(Step),
  final_answer: z.string(),
});

const completion = await openai.beta.chat.completions.parse({
  model: "gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
  messages: [
    { role: "system", content: "You are a helpful math tutor. Guide the user through the solution step by step." },
    { role: "user", content: "how can I solve 8x + 7 = -23" },
  ],
  response_format: zodResponseFormat(MathReasoning, "math_reasoning"),
});

const math_reasoning = completion.choices[0].message.parsed;
```

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

class Step(BaseModel):
    explanation: str
    output: str

class MathReasoning(BaseModel):
    steps: list[Step]
    final_answer: str

completion = client.beta.chat.completions.parse(
    model="gpt-4o-2024-08-06",

Structured data extraction

### Structured data extraction

You can define structured fields to extract from unstructured input data, such as reasearch papers.

Extracting data from research papers using Structured Outputs

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";
import { z } from "zod";
import { zodResponseFormat } from "openai/helpers/zod";

const openai = new OpenAI();

const ResearchPaperExtraction = z.object({
  title: z.string(),
  authors: z.array(z.string()),
  abstract: z.string(),
  keywords: z.array(z.string()),
});

const completion = await openai.beta.chat.completions.parse({
  model: "gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
  messages: [
    { role: "system", content: "You are an expert at structured data extraction. You will be given unstructured text from a research paper and should convert it into the given structure." },
    { role: "user", content: "..." },
  ],
  response_format: zodResponseFormat(ResearchPaperExtraction, "research_paper_extraction"),
});

const research_paper = completion.choices[0].message.parsed;
```

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

class ResearchPaperExtraction(BaseModel):
    title: str
    authors: list[str]
    abstract: str
    keywords: list[str]

completion = client.beta.chat.completions.parse(
    model="gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are an expert at structured data extraction. You will be given unstructured text from a research paper and should convert it into the given structure."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "..."}

UI generation

### UI Generation

You can generate valid HTML by representing it as recursive data structures with constraints, like enums.

Generating HTML using Structured Outputs

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";
import { z } from "zod";
import { zodResponseFormat } from "openai/helpers/zod";

const openai = new OpenAI();

const UI = z.lazy(() =>
  z.object({
    type: z.enum(["div", "button", "header", "section", "field", "form"]),
    label: z.string(),
    children: z.array(UI),
    attributes: z.array(
      z.object({
        name: z.string(),
        value: z.string(),
      })
    ),
  })
);

const completion = await openai.beta.chat.completions.parse({
  model: "gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
  messages: [
    {
      role: "system",
      content: "You are a UI generator AI. Convert the user input into a UI.",
    },
    { role: "user", content: "Make a User Profile Form" },
  ],
  response_format: zodResponseFormat(UI, "ui"),
});

const ui = completion.choices[0].message.parsed;
```

```python
from enum import Enum
from typing import List
from pydantic import BaseModel
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

class UIType(str, Enum):
    div = "div"
    button = "button"
    header = "header"
    section = "section"
    field = "field"
    form = "form"

class Attribute(BaseModel):
    name: str
    value: str

class UI(BaseModel):
    type: UIType
    label: str
    children: List["UI"] 
    attributes: List[Attribute]

UI.model_rebuild() # This is required to enable recursive types

class Response(BaseModel):
    ui: UI

completion = client.beta.chat.completions.parse(
    model="gpt-4o-2024-08-06",

Moderation

### Moderation

You can classify inputs on multiple categories, which is a common way of doing moderation.

Moderation using Structured Outputs

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";
import { z } from "zod";
import { zodResponseFormat } from "openai/helpers/zod";

const openai = new OpenAI();

const ContentCompliance = z.object({
  is_violating: z.boolean(),
  category: z.enum(["violence", "sexual", "self_harm"]).nullable(),
  explanation_if_violating: z.string().nullable(),
});

const completion = await openai.beta.chat.completions.parse({
  model: "gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
  messages: [
    { role: "system", content: "Determine if the user input violates specific guidelines and explain if they do." },
    { role: "user", content: "How do I prepare for a job interview?" },
  ],
  response_format: zodResponseFormat(ContentCompliance, "content_compliance"),
});

const compliance = completion.choices[0].message.parsed;
```

```python
from enum import Enum
from typing import Optional
from pydantic import BaseModel
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

class Category(str, Enum):
    violence = "violence"
    sexual = "sexual"
    self_harm = "self_harm"

class ContentCompliance(BaseModel):
    is_violating: bool
    category: Optional[Category]
    explanation_if_violating: Optional[str]

    }
  }'
```

How to use Structured Outputs with response\_format
---------------------------------------------------

You can use Structured Outputs with the new SDK helper to parse the model's output into your desired format, or you can specify the JSON schema directly.

**Note:** the first request you make with any schema will have additional latency as our API processes the schema, but subsequent requests with the same schema will not have additional latency.

SDK objects

Step 1: Define your object

First you must define an object or data structure to represent the JSON Schema that the model should be constrained to follow. See the [examples](/docs/guides/structured-outputs#examples) at the top of this guide for reference.

While Structured Outputs supports much of JSON Schema, some features are unavailable either for performance or technical reasons. See [here](/docs/guides/structured-outputs#supported-schemas) for more details.

For example, you can define an object like this:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel

class Step(BaseModel):
    explanation: str
    output: str

class MathResponse(BaseModel):
    steps: list[Step]
    final_answer: str
```

```javascript
import { z } from "zod";
import { zodResponseFormat } from "openai/helpers/zod";

const Step = z.object({
  explanation: z.string(),
  output: z.string(),
});

const MathResponse = z.object({
  steps: z.array(Step),
  final_answer: z.string(),
});
```

#### Tips for your data structure

To maximize the quality of model generations, we recommend the following:

*   Name keys clearly and intuitively
*   Create clear titles and descriptions for important keys in your structure
*   Create and use evals to determine the structure that works best for your use case

Step 2: Supply your object in the API call

You can use the `parse` method to automatically parse the JSON response into the object you defined.

Under the hood, the SDK takes care of supplying the JSON schema corresponding to your data structure, and then parsing the response as an object.

```python
completion = client.beta.chat.completions.parse(
    model="gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful math tutor. Guide the user through the solution step by step."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "how can I solve 8x + 7 = -23"}
    ],
    response_format=MathResponse
  )
```

```javascript
const completion = await openai.beta.chat.completions.parse({
  model: "gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
  messages: [
    { role: "system", content: "You are a helpful math tutor. Guide the user through the solution step by step." },
    { role: "user", content: "how can I solve 8x + 7 = -23" },
  ],
  response_format: zodResponseFormat(MathResponse, "math_response"),
});
```

Step 3: Handle edge cases

In some cases, the model might not generate a valid response that matches the provided JSON schema.

This can happen in the case of a refusal, if the model refuses to answer for safety reasons, or if for example you reach a max tokens limit and the response is incomplete.

Manual schema

Step 1: Define your schema

First you must design the JSON Schema that the model should be constrained to follow. See the [examples](/docs/guides/structured-outputs#examples) at the top of this guide for reference.

While Structured Outputs supports much of JSON Schema, some features are unavailable either for performance or technical reasons. See [here](/docs/guides/structured-outputs#supported-schemas) for more details.

#### Tips for your JSON Schema

To maximize the quality of model generations, we recommend the following:

*   Name keys clearly and intuitively
*   Create clear titles and descriptions for important keys in your structure
*   Create and use evals to determine the structure that works best for your use case

Step 2: Supply your schema in the API call

To use Structured Outputs, simply specify

```json
response_format: { "type": "json_schema", "json_schema": … , "strict": true }
```

For example:

```python
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful math tutor. Guide the user through the solution step by step."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "how can I solve 8x + 7 = -23"}
    ],
    response_format={
        "type": "json_schema",
        "json_schema": {
            "name": "math_response",
            "schema": {
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                    "steps": {
                        "type": "array",
                        "items": {
                            "type": "object",
                            "properties": {
                                "explanation": {"type": "string"},
                                "output": {"type": "string"}
                            },
                            "required": ["explanation", "output"],
                            "additionalProperties": False
                        }
                    },
                    "final_answer": {"type": "string"}
                },
                "required": ["steps", "final_answer"],
                "additionalProperties": False
            },
            "strict": True
        }
    }
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

```javascript
const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
    model: "gpt-4o-2024-08-06",

        { role: "user", content: "how can I solve 8x + 7 = -23" }
    ],
    store: true,
    response_format: {
        type: "json_schema",
        json_schema: {
            name: "math_response",
            schema: {
                type: "object",
                properties: {
                    steps: {
                        type: "array",
                        items: {
                            type: "object",
                            properties: {

                                output: { type: "string" }
                            },
                            required: ["explanation", "output"],
                            additionalProperties: false
                        }
                    },
                    final_answer: { type: "string" }
                },
                required: ["steps", "final_answer"],
                additionalProperties: false
            },
            strict: true
        }
    }
});

console.log(response.choices[0].message.content);
```

```bash
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "system",
        "content": "You are a helpful math tutor. Guide the user through the solution step by step."
      },
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "how can I solve 8x + 7 = -23"
      }
    ],
    "response_format": {
      "type": "json_schema",
      "json_schema": {
        "name": "math_response",
        "schema": {
          "type": "object",
          "properties": {
            "steps": {
              "type": "array",
              "items": {
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                  "explanation": { "type": "string" },
                  "output": { "type": "string" }
                },
                "required": ["explanation", "output"],
                "additionalProperties": false
              }
            },
            "final_answer": { "type": "string" }
          },
          "required": ["steps", "final_answer"],
          "additionalProperties": false
        },
        "strict": true
      }
    }
  }'
```

**Note:** the first request you make with any schema will have additional latency as our API processes the schema, but subsequent requests with the same schema will not have additional latency.

Step 3: Handle edge cases

In some cases, the model might not generate a valid response that matches the provided JSON schema.

This can happen in the case of a refusal, if the model refuses to answer for safety reasons, or if for example you reach a max tokens limit and the response is incomplete.

```javascript
try {
  const completion = await openai.chat.completions.create({
    model: "gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
    messages: [{
        role: "system",
        content: "You are a helpful math tutor. Guide the user through the solution step by step.",
      },
      {
        role: "user",
        content: "how can I solve 8x + 7 = -23"
      },
    ],
    store: true,
    response_format: {
      type: "json_schema",
      json_schema: {
        name: "math_response",
        schema: {
          type: "object",
          properties: {
            steps: {
              type: "array",
              items: {
                type: "object",
                properties: {
                  explanation: {
                    type: "string"
                  },
                  output: {
                    type: "string"
                  },
                },
                required: ["explanation", "output"],
                additionalProperties: false,
              },
            },
            final_answer: {
              type: "string"
            },
          },
          required: ["steps", "final_answer"],
          additionalProperties: false,
        },
        strict: true,
      },
    },
    max_tokens: 50,
  });

  if (completion.choices[0].finish_reason === "length") {
    // Handle the case where the model did not return a complete response
    throw new Error("Incomplete response");
  }

  const math_response = completion.choices[0].message;

  if (math_response.refusal) {
    // handle refusal
    console.log(math_response.refusal);
  } else if (math_response.content) {
    console.log(math_response.content);
  } else {
    throw new Error("No response content");
  }
} catch (e) {
  // Handle edge cases
  console.error(e);
}
```

```python
try:
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
        messages=[
            {
                "role": "system",
                "content": "You are a helpful math tutor. Guide the user through the solution step by step.",
            },
            {"role": "user", "content": "how can I solve 8x + 7 = -23"},
        ],
        response_format={
            "type": "json_schema",
            "json_schema": {
                "name": "math_response",
                "strict": True,
                "schema": {
                    "type": "object",
                    "properties": {
                        "steps": {
                            "type": "array",
                            "items": {
                                "type": "object",
                                "properties": {
                                    "explanation": {"type": "string"},
                                    "output": {"type": "string"},
                                },
                                "required": ["explanation", "output"],
                                "additionalProperties": False,
                            },
                        },
                        "final_answer": {"type": "string"},
                    },
                    "required": ["steps", "final_answer"],
                    "additionalProperties": False,
                },
            },
        },
        strict=True,
    )
except Exception as e:
    # handle errors like finish_reason, refusal, content_filter, etc.
    pass
```

Step 4: Use the generated structured data in a type-safe way

Typically, when using Structured Outputs you will have a type or class in the type-system of your programming language representing the JSON Schema as an object.

Once you have confirmed that you have received the JSON guaranteed to match the schema you requested, you can now safely parse it to the corresponding type.

For example:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, ValidationError
from typing import List

# Define types that match the JSON Schema using pydantic models
class Step(BaseModel):
    explanation: str
    output: str

class Solution(BaseModel):
    steps: List[Step]
    final_answer: str

...

try:
    # Parse and validate the response content
    solution = Solution.parse_raw(response.choices[0].message.content)
    print(solution)
except ValidationError as e:
    # Handle validation errors
    print(e.json())
```

```javascript
// Here we specify types in TypeScript that exactly match the JSON Schema we provided when calling the OpenAI API. Note that these *must* be kept in sync.

type Step = {
  explanation: string;
  output: string;
};

type Solution = {
  steps: Step[];
  final_answer: string;
};

...

// Now so long as the JSON Schema we created was exactly equivalent to our TypeScript types, this is type-safe
const solution = JSON.parse(response.choices[0].message.content)) as Solution
```

### Refusals with Structured Outputs

When using Structured Outputs with user-generated input, OpenAI models may occasionally refuse to fulfill the request for safety reasons. Since a refusal does not necessarily follow the schema you have supplied in `response_format`, the API response will include a new field called `refusal` to indicate that the model refused to fulfill the request.

When the `refusal` property appears in your output object, you might present the refusal in your UI, or include conditional logic in code that consumes the response to handle the case of a refused request.

```python
class Step(BaseModel):
    explanation: str
    output: str

class MathReasoning(BaseModel):
    steps: list[Step]
    final_answer: str

completion = client.beta.chat.completions.parse(
    model="gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful math tutor. Guide the user through the solution step by step."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "how can I solve 8x + 7 = -23"}
    ],
    response_format=MathReasoning,
)

math_reasoning = completion.choices[0].message

# If the model refuses to respond, you will get a refusal message
if (math_reasoning.refusal):
    print(math_reasoning.refusal)
else:
    print(math_reasoning.parsed)
```

```javascript
const Step = z.object({
  explanation: z.string(),
  output: z.string(),
});

const MathReasoning = z.object({
  steps: z.array(Step),
  final_answer: z.string(),
});

const completion = await openai.beta.chat.completions.parse({
  model: "gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
  messages: [
    { role: "system", content: "You are a helpful math tutor. Guide the user through the solution step by step." },
    { role: "user", content: "how can I solve 8x + 7 = -23" },
  ],
  response_format: zodResponseFormat(MathReasoning, "math_reasoning"),
});

const math_reasoning = completion.choices[0].message

// If the model refuses to respond, you will get a refusal message
if (math_reasoning.refusal) {
  console.log(math_reasoning.refusal);
} else {
  console.log(math_reasoning.parsed);
}
```

The API response from a refusal will look something like this:

```json
{
  "id": "chatcmpl-9nYAG9LPNonX8DAyrkwYfemr3C8HC",
  "object": "chat.completion",
  "created": 1721596428,
  "model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
  "choices": [
    {
      "index": 0,
      "message": {
        "role": "assistant",
        "refusal": "I'm sorry, I cannot assist with that request."
      },
      "logprobs": null,
      "finish_reason": "stop"
    }
  ],
  "usage": {
    "prompt_tokens": 81,
    "completion_tokens": 11,
    "total_tokens": 92,
    "completion_tokens_details": {
      "reasoning_tokens": 0,
      "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0,
      "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0
    }
  },
  "system_fingerprint": "fp_3407719c7f"
}
```

### Tips and best practices

#### Handling user-generated input

If your application is using user-generated input, make sure your prompt includes instructions on how to handle situations where the input cannot result in a valid response.

The model will always try to adhere to the provided schema, which can result in hallucinations if the input is completely unrelated to the schema.

You could include language in your prompt to specify that you want to return empty parameters, or a specific sentence, if the model detects that the input is incompatible with the task.

#### Handling mistakes

Structured Outputs can still contain mistakes. If you see mistakes, try adjusting your instructions, providing examples in the system instructions, or splitting tasks into simpler subtasks. Refer to the [prompt engineering guide](/docs/guides/prompt-engineering) for more guidance on how to tweak your inputs.

#### Avoid JSON schema divergence

To prevent your JSON Schema and corresponding types in your programming language from diverging, we strongly recommend using the native Pydantic/zod sdk support.

If you prefer to specify the JSON schema directly, you could add CI rules that flag when either the JSON schema or underlying data objects are edited, or add a CI step that auto-generates the JSON Schema from type definitions (or vice-versa).

Streaming
---------

You can use streaming to process model responses or function call arguments as they are being generated, and parse them as structured data.

That way, you don't have to wait for the entire response to complete before handling it. This is particularly useful if you would like to display JSON fields one by one, or handle function call arguments as soon as they are available.

We recommend relying on the SDKs to handle streaming with Structured Outputs. You can find an example of how to stream function call arguments without the SDK `stream` helper in the [function calling guide](/docs/guides/function-calling#advanced-usage).

Here is how you can stream a model response with the `stream` helper:

```python
from typing import List
from pydantic import BaseModel
from openai import OpenAI

class EntitiesModel(BaseModel):
    attributes: List[str]
    colors: List[str]
    animals: List[str]

client = OpenAI()

with client.beta.chat.completions.stream(
    model="gpt-4o",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "Extract entities from the input text"},
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog with piercing blue eyes",
        },
    ],
    response_format=EntitiesModel,
) as stream:
    for event in stream:
        if event.type == "content.delta":
            if event.parsed is not None:
                # Print the parsed data as JSON
                print("content.delta parsed:", event.parsed)
        elif event.type == "content.done":
            print("content.done")
        elif event.type == "error":
            print("Error in stream:", event.error)

final_completion = stream.get_final_completion()
print("Final completion:", final_completion)
```

```js
import OpenAI from "openai";
import { zodResponseFormat } from "openai/helpers/zod";
import { z } from "zod";
export const openai = new OpenAI();

const EntitiesSchema = z.object({
  attributes: z.array(z.string()),
  colors: z.array(z.string()),
  animals: z.array(z.string()),
});

const stream = openai.beta.chat.completions
  .stream({
    model: "gpt-4o",
    messages: [
      { role: "system", content: "Extract entities from the input text" },
      {
        role: "user",
        content:
          "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog with piercing blue eyes",
      },
    ],
    response_format: zodResponseFormat(EntitiesSchema, "entities"),
  })
  .on("refusal.done", () => console.log("request refused"))
  .on("content.delta", ({ snapshot, parsed }) => {
    console.log("content:", snapshot);
    console.log("parsed:", parsed);
    console.log();
  })
  .on("content.done", (props) => {
    console.log(props);
  });

await stream.done();

const finalCompletion = await stream.finalChatCompletion();

console.log(finalCompletion);
```

You can also use the `stream` helper to parse function call arguments:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
import openai
from openai import OpenAI

class GetWeather(BaseModel):
    city: str
    country: str

client = OpenAI()

with client.beta.chat.completions.stream(
    model="gpt-4o",
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "What's the weather like in SF and London?",
        },
    ],
    tools=[
        openai.pydantic_function_tool(GetWeather, name="get_weather"),
    ],
    parallel_tool_calls=True,
) as stream:
    for event in stream:
        if event.type == "tool_calls.function.arguments.delta" or event.type == "tool_calls.function.arguments.done":
            print(event)

print(stream.get_final_completion())
```

```js
import { zodFunction } from "openai/helpers/zod";
import OpenAI from "openai/index";
import { z } from "zod";

const GetWeatherArgs = z.object({
  city: z.string(),
  country: z.string(),
});

const client = new OpenAI();

const stream = client.beta.chat.completions
  .stream({
    model: "gpt-4o",
    messages: [
      {
        role: "user",
        content: "What's the weather like in SF and London?",
      },
    ],
    tools: [zodFunction({ name: "get_weather", parameters: GetWeatherArgs })],
  })
  .on("tool_calls.function.arguments.delta", (props) =>
    console.log("tool_calls.function.arguments.delta", props)
  )
  .on("tool_calls.function.arguments.done", (props) =>
    console.log("tool_calls.function.arguments.done", props)
  )
  .on("refusal.delta", ({ delta }) => {
    process.stdout.write(delta);
  })
  .on("refusal.done", () => console.log("request refused"));

const completion = await stream.finalChatCompletion();

console.log("final completion:", completion);
```

Supported schemas
-----------------

Structured Outputs supports a subset of the [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/docs) language.

#### Supported types

The following types are supported for Structured Outputs:

*   String
*   Number
*   Boolean
*   Integer
*   Object
*   Array
*   Enum
*   anyOf

#### Root objects must not be `anyOf`

Note that the root level object of a schema must be an object, and not use `anyOf`. A pattern that appears in Zod (as one example) is using a discriminated union, which produces an `anyOf` at the top level. So code such as the following won't work:

```javascript
import { z } from 'zod';
import { zodResponseFormat } from 'openai/helpers/zod';

const BaseResponseSchema = z.object({ /* ... */ });
const UnsuccessfulResponseSchema = z.object({ /* ... */ });

const finalSchema = z.discriminatedUnion('status', [
    BaseResponseSchema,
    UnsuccessfulResponseSchema,
]);

// Invalid JSON Schema for Structured Outputs
const json = zodResponseFormat(finalSchema, 'final_schema');
```

#### All fields must be `required`

To use Structured Outputs, all fields or function parameters must be specified as `required`.

```json
{
    "name": "get_weather",
    "description": "Fetches the weather in the given location",
    "strict": true,
    "parameters": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "location": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "The location to get the weather for"
            },
            "unit": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "The unit to return the temperature in",
                "enum": ["F", "C"]
            }
        },
        "additionalProperties": false,
        "required": ["location", "unit"]
    }
}
```

Although all fields must be required (and the model will return a value for each parameter), it is possible to emulate an optional parameter by using a union type with `null`.

```json
{
    "name": "get_weather",
    "description": "Fetches the weather in the given location",
    "strict": true,
    "parameters": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "location": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "The location to get the weather for"
            },
            "unit": {
                "type": ["string", "null"],
                "description": "The unit to return the temperature in",
                "enum": ["F", "C"]
            }
        },
        "additionalProperties": false,
        "required": [
            "location", "unit"
        ]
    }
}
```

#### Objects have limitations on nesting depth and size

A schema may have up to 100 object properties total, with up to 5 levels of nesting.

#### Limitations on total string size

In a schema, total string length of all property names, definition names, enum values, and const values cannot exceed 15,000 characters.

#### Limitations on enum size

A schema may have up to 500 enum values across all enum properties.

For a single enum property with string values, the total string length of all enum values cannot exceed 7,500 characters when there are more than 250 enum values.

#### `additionalProperties: false` must always be set in objects

`additionalProperties` controls whether it is allowable for an object to contain additional keys / values that were not defined in the JSON Schema.

Structured Outputs only supports generating specified keys / values, so we require developers to set `additionalProperties: false` to opt into Structured Outputs.

```json
{
    "name": "get_weather",
    "description": "Fetches the weather in the given location",
    "strict": true,
    "schema": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "location": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "The location to get the weather for"
            },
            "unit": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "The unit to return the temperature in",
                "enum": ["F", "C"]
            }
        },
        "additionalProperties": false,
        "required": [
            "location", "unit"
        ]
    }
}
```

#### Key ordering

When using Structured Outputs, outputs will be produced in the same order as the ordering of keys in the schema.

#### Some type-specific keywords are not yet supported

Notable keywords not supported include:

*   **For strings:** `minLength`, `maxLength`, `pattern`, `format`
*   **For numbers:** `minimum`, `maximum`, `multipleOf`
*   **For objects:** `patternProperties`, `unevaluatedProperties`, `propertyNames`, `minProperties`, `maxProperties`
*   **For arrays:** `unevaluatedItems`, `contains`, `minContains`, `maxContains`, `minItems`, `maxItems`, `uniqueItems`

If you turn on Structured Outputs by supplying `strict: true` and call the API with an unsupported JSON Schema, you will receive an error.

#### For `anyOf`, the nested schemas must each be a valid JSON Schema per this subset

Here's an example supported anyOf schema:

```json
{
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
        "item": {
            "anyOf": [
                {
                    "type": "object",
                    "description": "The user object to insert into the database",
                    "properties": {
                        "name": {
                            "type": "string",
                            "description": "The name of the user"
                        },
                        "age": {
                            "type": "number",
                            "description": "The age of the user"
                        }
                    },
                    "additionalProperties": false,
                    "required": [
                        "name",
                        "age"
                    ]
                },
                {
                    "type": "object",
                    "description": "The address object to insert into the database",
                    "properties": {
                        "number": {
                            "type": "string",
                            "description": "The number of the address. Eg. for 123 main st, this would be 123"
                        },
                        "street": {
                            "type": "string",
                            "description": "The street name. Eg. for 123 main st, this would be main st"
                        },
                        "city": {
                            "type": "string",
                            "description": "The city of the address"
                        }
                    },
                    "additionalProperties": false,
                    "required": [
                        "number",
                        "street",
                        "city"
                    ]
                }
            ]
        }
    },
    "additionalProperties": false,
    "required": [
        "item"
    ]
}
```

#### Definitions are supported

You can use definitions to define subschemas which are referenced throughout your schema. The following is a simple example.

```json
{
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
        "steps": {
            "type": "array",
            "items": {
                "$ref": "#/$defs/step"
            }
        },
        "final_answer": {
            "type": "string"
        }
    },
    "$defs": {
        "step": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "explanation": {
                    "type": "string"
                },
                "output": {
                    "type": "string"
                }
            },
            "required": [
                "explanation",
                "output"
            ],
            "additionalProperties": false
        }
    },
    "required": [
        "steps",
        "final_answer"
    ],
    "additionalProperties": false
}
```

#### Recursive schemas are supported

Sample recursive schema using `#` to indicate root recursion.

```json
{
    "name": "ui",
    "description": "Dynamically generated UI",
    "strict": true,
    "schema": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "type": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "The type of the UI component",
                "enum": ["div", "button", "header", "section", "field", "form"]
            },
            "label": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "The label of the UI component, used for buttons or form fields"
            },
            "children": {
                "type": "array",
                "description": "Nested UI components",
                "items": {
                    "$ref": "#"
                }
            },
            "attributes": {
                "type": "array",
                "description": "Arbitrary attributes for the UI component, suitable for any element",
                "items": {
                    "type": "object",
                    "properties": {
                        "name": {
                            "type": "string",
                            "description": "The name of the attribute, for example onClick or className"
                        },
                        "value": {
                            "type": "string",
                            "description": "The value of the attribute"
                        }
                    },
                    "additionalProperties": false,
                    "required": ["name", "value"]
                }
            }
        },
        "required": ["type", "label", "children", "attributes"],
        "additionalProperties": false
    }
}
```

Sample recursive schema using explicit recursion:

```json
{
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
        "linked_list": {
            "$ref": "#/$defs/linked_list_node"
        }
    },
    "$defs": {
        "linked_list_node": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "value": {
                    "type": "number"
                },
                "next": {
                    "anyOf": [
                        {
                            "$ref": "#/$defs/linked_list_node"
                        },
                        {
                            "type": "null"
                        }
                    ]
                }
            },
            "additionalProperties": false,
            "required": [
                "next",
                "value"
            ]
        }
    },
    "additionalProperties": false,
    "required": [
        "linked_list"
    ]
}
```

JSON mode
---------

JSON mode is a more basic version of the Structured Outputs feature. While JSON mode ensures that model output is valid JSON, Structured Outputs reliably matches the model's output to the schema you specify. We recommend you use Structured Outputs if it is supported for your use case.

When JSON mode is turned on, the model's output is ensured to be valid JSON, except for in some edge cases that you should detect and handle appropriately.

To turn on JSON mode with the Chat Completions or Assistants API you can set the `response_format` to `{ "type": "json_object" }`. If you are using function calling, JSON mode is always turned on.

Important notes:

*   When using JSON mode, you must always instruct the model to produce JSON via some message in the conversation, for example via your system message. If you don't include an explicit instruction to generate JSON, the model may generate an unending stream of whitespace and the request may run continually until it reaches the token limit. To help ensure you don't forget, the API will throw an error if the string "JSON" does not appear somewhere in the context.
*   JSON mode will not guarantee the output matches any specific schema, only that it is valid and parses without errors. You should use Structured Outputs to ensure it matches your schema, or if that is not possible, you should use a validation library and potentially retries to ensure that the output matches your desired schema.
*   Your application must detect and handle the edge cases that can result in the model output not being a complete JSON object (see below)

Handling edge cases

```javascript
const we_did_not_specify_stop_tokens = true;

try {
  const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
    model: "gpt-3.5-turbo-0125",
    messages: [
      {
        role: "system",
        content: "You are a helpful assistant designed to output JSON.",
      },
      { role: "user", content: "Who won the world series in 2020? Please respond in the format {winner: ...}" },
    ],
    store: true,
    response_format: { type: "json_object" },
  });

  // Check if the conversation was too long for the context window, resulting in incomplete JSON 
  if (response.choices[0].message.finish_reason === "length") {
    // your code should handle this error case
  }

  // Check if the OpenAI safety system refused the request and generated a refusal instead
  if (response.choices[0].message[0].refusal) {
    // your code should handle this error case
    // In this case, the .content field will contain the explanation (if any) that the model generated for why it is refusing
    console.log(response.choices[0].message[0].refusal)
  }

  // Check if the model's output included restricted content, so the generation of JSON was halted and may be partial
  if (response.choices[0].message.finish_reason === "content_filter") {
    // your code should handle this error case
